          The US - INDIA ART and Culture Exchange Center is proud to have worked
          on a significant number of distinguished sculpture and art projects in
          India and around the world as a reputable Indian Sculpture Company.
          Our artwork is related not only to paintings, but also large-scale
          murals and megastructures as parts of various conceptual artwork
          projects.

        <p className="mb-4">
          Museums, industrial halls, hospitals, and airports are only some of
          the homes to our artwork. Our team always tends to use the traditional
          ways of making art wherever this is possible. However, we embrace
          modern technology and the opportunities it offers as well.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          We have our own foundry and workshops. This is what enables us to
          design and make unique and versatile projects.

              Our advanced foundry covers an area of 1600 sq. ft. It is located
              in Ghaziabad. It supports all kinds of techniques and processes,
              with a casting capacity of 500 kilograms per day. This depicts the
              extent of works we are capable of doing.

                Our artwork foundry is suitable for making sculptures - from
                miniatures (size 2 –3 cm) to large sculptural compositions (size
                10 m and more) in alloys based on:

            <p>
              We have specialized equipment, technology, and materials optimized
              for precision casting process in liquid self-fastening masses on
              wax models. For the production of elastic negatives, we use
              thermoplastic materials, silicones, and polyurethanes. For the
              production of wax models, we use waxes according to internal
              recipes. Also, we always use the finest waxes according to the
              special requirements of the project.
            </p>
            <p>
              In our foundry, alloys are made from primary metals in the
              percentage ratio of alloying elements, which provides the optimal
              technology during melting, casting and metal processing, and
              optimum exploitation properties (mechanical properties and
              corrosion resistance) of our products.
            </p>
            <p>
              n our foundry, we also do the patina effect. Patina is
              accomplished by chemical agents that produce alloys in accordance
              with the colors of the base metal minerals.

              Our foundry is suitable for casting and welding of non-ferrous
              metals (bronze, brass, and aluminum). The casting of industrial as
              well as less complicated castings is carried out by the
              sand-casting technique (natural and CO2 sand).
            </p>
            <p>
              We manufacture industrial castings on a milling machine. We issue
              an attestation for the CuSn14 bronze artwork
            </p>
            <p>
              The castings are welded with modern TIG and MIG MAG devices of the
              latest generation - with the double pulsed current - without
              cracks, deformations, and porosity.

          As already mentioned, our foundry supports the traditional techniques,
          such as the “lost wax” technique. We have the infrastructure good for
          heating up the moulds up to required degrees Fahrenheit, which is
          necessary for the essence of this ancient technique – complete wax
          melting.

          We even produce some architectural elements in our specialized

              The process of making murals, creating sculptures and other
              artwork projects is complex and, depending on the material and
              technique, involves several phases. We have a 2000 sq.ft. area
              workshop for these purposes located in Faridabad.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is the place where we make glass mosaic artwork, clay

            </p>
            <p>
              In our workshops, we also have enough space to assemble
              large-scale sculptures and installations. Our welders and other
              experts in artwork technical solutions will do their assembly job
              in an impeccable manner. Our workers and technicians are ready to
              securely disassemble removable parts of the installation and
              prepare them for transportation.

            <p>
              Our workshop is also used for glass cutting. In addition, we
              provide precise, high quality and quick cut metal works, including
              stainless steel and aluminum. This is done with the help of a
              modern CNC machine. Finally, in our workshop, we prepare and
              finalize various toughened glass design projects.

            according to the needs of different projects, both micro and
            large-scale ones. Portable lights reinforce this idea. The spatial
            organization also allows lots of storage space for our models and

            Even though most of our work requires a workshop, we also often work

            animal protection during our work. Devotion, precision, knowledge,
            skilfulness, and experience, as well as good infrastructure, guide
            us through our work with one goal: making mesmerizing art.
